This is my portfolio, here you can take a glimps of my projects.

## Technologies I used to create this project are:
Javascript, NextJs, TailwindCss, React Icons.

in this projet I got to implement what I learned in NextJs & TailwindCss, I had lots of fun creating this project not only because it's about me, it's more because of the fact that I learned new manipulation techniques of css, hope you enjoy it.
